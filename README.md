# VHDL System Design Laboratory

## Overview

This repository contains materials and exercises for the **VHDL System Design Laboratory** at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**. 

The subject of this lab course is the design of digital integrated circuits using the hardware description language **VHDL**. The lab includes both the **modeling** and **simulation** of digital circuits as well as their **synthesis into gate netlists**.
